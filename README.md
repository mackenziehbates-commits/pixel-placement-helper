## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   - Or install via Homebrew: `brew install node`

2. **Get an OpenAI API Key**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
   - Create an account and generate an API key

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mackenziebates/pixel-placement-helper
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to Use

1. **Enter Website URL**: The URL of the website to check
2. **Select Platform**: Choose from the supported advertising platforms

4. **Enter Event Name**: Optional - the event name you're tracking
5. **Paste Pixel Snippet**: The complete pixel code to verify
6. **Click "Check Pixel Placement"**

## What It Checks

- **Presence**: Is the pixel code present on the page?
- **Placement**: Is it in the correct section (head vs body)?
- **Syntax**: Are there any obvious syntax issues?
- **Platform-specific**: Does it contain expected functions (fbq for Facebook, gtag for Google, etc.)?
- **Event matching**: Does the event name match what's in the snippet?

## Results

The tool will show:
- ✅ **PASS**: Pixel is correctly placed and configured
- ❌ **FAIL**: Issues found that need attention
